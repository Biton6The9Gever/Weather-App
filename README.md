Weather app I made in the pursuit of learning about the usage of API in C#

Also, learn about async methods and multi-threading in C#

This project has no Unique UI/UX i may add UI for this project in the future.


This project has 2 functions one of which is detecting the location of the user via their IP and using IP identifier API to get the city he lives in and therefore provide the weather in his (or near) home. 

Another function is the option of using any length system of length normal (km) / American (miles)


Thanks for reading!
